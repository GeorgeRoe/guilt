CPU profiles are essential for GUILT to accurately estimate the energy consumption of jobs running on different types of CPUs.

## Structure

Each CPU profile has the following fields:

::field-group
::field{name="name" typ="string" required}
The name of the CPU profile, typically corresponding to a specific CPU model (e.g., `"AMD Epyc 9654"`).
::

::field{name="cores" type="integer" required}
The total number of CPU cores available in the CPU model.
::

::field{name="tdp" type="float" required}
The Thermal Design Power (TDP) of the CPU in watts.
::
::

## Adding a CPU Profile

To add a new CPU profile, you must edit `~/.guilt/cpu_profiles.json` and include the new profile in the JSON array. For example:

```json [~/.guilt/cpu_profiles.json]
[
  {
    "name": "AMD Epyc 7302",
    "cores": 16,
    "tdp": 155.0
  },
  {
    "name": "AMD Epyc 7502",
    "cores": 32,
    "tdp": 180.0
  },
  {
    "name": "AMD Epyc 9654",
    "cores": 96,
    "tdp": 360.0
  }
]
```

The above example would create this configuration:

| Name          | Cores | TDP (W) |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| AMD Epyc 7302 | 16    | 155.0   |
| AMD Epyc 7502 | 32    | 180.0   |
| AMD Epyc 9654 | 96    | 360.0   |
