Once you have installed GUILT, there are a few initial steps you should take to ensure it is set up correctly for your environment.

If you have not yet installed GUILT, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation) first.

## Setup Steps

::steps{level=4}
#### Run the setup utility

After installation, run the GUILT setup command to configure initial settings.

```bash [Terminal]
guilt setup
```

This command will use an interactive prompt to help you set default options for your GUILT configuration.

#### Backfill historical data

It is likely that you have already run jobs on your HPC system before installing GUILT. If you wish to include these historical jobs in GUILT's outputs, you will need to backfill this data.

```bash [Terminal]
# Backfill historical job data
guilt backfill

# Process the jobs and calculate carbon emissions
guilt process
```
