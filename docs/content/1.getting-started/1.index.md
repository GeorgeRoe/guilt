GUILT is a command line interface (CLI) tool designed to help users track and analyse the carbon emissions associated with their computing jobs on SLURM-managed high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

It is highly recommended to read through the entire documentation to understand how to use GUILT effectively and to be aware of its limitations.

## Is GUILT right for me?

- You are a user of a SLURM-managed HPC system in the UK and want to understand the carbon emissions of your computing jobs.
- You are interested in reducing the carbon footprint of your computing work and want to make informed decisions about your job submissions.
- You are required to report the carbon emissions of your computing jobs for funding or institutional purposes.

## Scope

- GUILT only works with SLURM, no other schedulers are supported.
- GUILT only works in the UK, using the UK's carbon intensity data from [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/).
- GUILT only estimates the carbon emissions of computing jobs, it is not 100% accurate and should be used as a guide rather than a precise measurement.
