GUILT is a command line interface (CLI) tool designed to help users track and analyse the carbon emissions associated with their computing jobs on SLURM-managed high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

## Scope

- GUILT only works with SLURM, no other schedulers are supported.
- GUILT only works in the UK, using the UK's carbon intensity data from [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/).
